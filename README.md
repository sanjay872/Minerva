# Minerva
Decentralized Online Learning Platform.
# Project Description
We have created an online learning platform using web3. The users can upload educational videos. And can view what others have uploaded through the platform. The users can pay for the course via Ethereum blockchain.
It is Fast, User-friendly and Secure at the same time. The instructors will be benefitted by uploading their course and getting paid for it without providing a cut to a middleman. The students can be benefitted by the accessibility of these courses anywhere in the world.
Teachers will provide the courses at a lower price for a competitive edge and the students would be able to afford them.Teachers who are looking for spreading their knowledge will find this platform really useful.
